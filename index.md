[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) is an online database of academic publications in computer science and related fields. Handily, all of its data is available as an XML file, which can be converted into an SQL database and queried. Here, I share a few fun facts I discovered while exploring the data that DBLP holds about two of the main conferences on programming languages; namely, POPL and PLDI.

_Note: In what follows, I define a paper to be any entry in the proceedings that is at least four pages long. This slightly coarse rule means that some very short but legitimate papers may not get counted. There may also be a small number of entries that are not legitimate papers, such as extended tributes or announcements, but which get counted anyway._
